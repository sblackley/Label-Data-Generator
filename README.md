## Summary

This is a tool I wrote to automate data collection for a task I was given to create custom labels. Previously data had to be individually copied and pasted from a table into four fields in a label template, so I created this program to search for the IDs of the data I needed and then format and output them so that each block could be directly copied into the template. 

It's functional enough for my own personal use, but is still very much in development as I continue to work out bugs and refine some things. 

## Instructions

* Paste the CSV data into the designated box or click the Example Data button to populate the box with test data

* Click the Load button

* Enter the reset numbers to search for in the designated box, each on a new line (if testing, you can look through the CSV data to find those numbers, preceded by RESET)

* Click the Search button and the results will be formatted and displayed below

* After performing the search the CSV data that was loaded clears, so that button must be clicked again to perform additional searches
